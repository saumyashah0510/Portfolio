# 🎬 The Multiverse Portfolio

> "Why build a website when you can build a universe?"

A cinematic, interactive developer portfolio built with **React**, **Three.js**, and **Framer Motion**. This project treats every section of the page as a different TV Show/Movie universe, complete with dynamic themes and synchronized audio.

1.  **Home:** *Into the Spider-Verse* (Glitch Effects, Comic Style)
2.  **About:** *The Office* (Dunder Mifflin Aesthetic, Paper Textures)
3.  **Skills:** *Game of Thrones* (3D Rotating Sigils, Light/Dark Factions)
4.  **Projects:** *Suits* (Glassmorphism, High-End Corporate Vibe)
5.  **Contact:** *How I Met Your Mother* (MacLaren's Pub, The Playbook)

## ✨ Key Features

* **Multiverse Theme Engine:** Toggling Light/Dark mode doesn't just change colors—it changes the *entire universe*.
    * *Example:* In the GOT section, Dark Mode is "The Night's Watch" (Snow), while Light Mode is "King's Landing" (Fire/Gold).
* **Spatial Audio System:** A custom Sound Manager detects which section is currently visible on the screen and cross-fades the background music automatically.
* **3D Interactive Elements:** Custom 3D carousels and physics-based interactions using Framer Motion.
* **TV Static Transitions:** Retro TV static effects when switching universes.
* **The Dock:** A floating MacOS-style navigation dock for quick travel.
